        <p class="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The research explores how headteachers in Malaysia's high-performing primary schools develop, sustain, and model resilience — particularly during adversity such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Through semi-structured interviews with high-performing headteachers and education experts across Malaysia, the study identifies resilience factors that enable school leaders to maintain performance under pressure.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-3">Why This Matters</h3>
        <p class="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed">
          School leadership burnout is a growing crisis globally. Headteachers face mounting pressure from academic targets, parental expectations, policy changes, and — since 2020 — pandemic disruption. Dr. Hamidah's research doesn't come from an ivory tower: it's grounded in her own experience managing schools of up to 1,700 students through exactly these challenges. The resulting model provides a framework that education systems and private school groups can use to develop resilient leaders.

              In this paper, we explore the modelling of resiliency among educational leaders which promote to resilient schools. The pandemic has a firmer grip on everybody and batters each of people more physically, mentally, and emotionally. Disruptions and change in daily activities caused by the pandemic have led to uncontrolled feelings of stress. The high performing head teachers have sustainable work done and they find ways to develop the resilience to focus their work from distractions. This study explored resilient factors and challenges of seven of high performing head teachers and two expertise from a few states in Malaysia. Based on the data collected through semi-structured interviews the study seeks to identify the positive relationship between resilience and positive school outcomes.
